I used bootstrat for palcing the tag "div" and css for few adjustments on the layout, 
I had no time to do more css for design.
I used php7, mysql for database and plane api from scratch.

please give me the oportuniy to grow with your company! Thank you!


TO RUN:

run the index1.php and fill up the full name text box and then choose options on each div category
the click submit order then the api will get the data and display on the screen the last row which is the last order made.
